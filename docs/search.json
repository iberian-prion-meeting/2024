The impact of that event shaped our determination to unravel the mysteries of prion diseases, which continue to pose immense challenges to patients and researchers alike. While a cure remains elusive, the past two decades have witnessed remarkable advancements in the field of prion science.\nThe Iberian Prion Congress has always been guided by the principles of the One Health approach, bringing together experts from diverse disciplines to address the shared molecular mechanisms of prion diseases and other protein misfolding disorders prevalent in our aging society. This interdisciplinary collaboration has played a crucial role in our quest to develop effective treatments and interventions.\nWe are proud to host the 12th Iberian Prion Congress at the prestigious Universidad de Santiago - Galicia, where renowned scientists, medical doctors, biologists, veterinarians, biotechnologists, biochemists, and other specialists from the Iberian Peninsula and beyond will convene. This gathering provides a unique platform for fostering and strengthening interdisciplinary collaborations, enabling us to collectively tackle the challenges that lie ahead.\nIn particular, we are committed to nurturing the participation of young scientists. Their innovative ideas, fresh perspectives, and groundbreaking research are the keys to unlocking new avenues in prion science. The congress will feature dedicated sessions and interactive discussions that offer young researchers the opportunity to present and engage with their peers, fostering an environment of mentorship and knowledge exchange.\nAs we embark on this scientific journey at the Universidad de Santiago - Galicia, we are not only inspired by the vibrant atmosphere of this historic city but also by the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose that permeates the Iberian Prion Congress. Together, we will strive to transcend boundaries, explore new frontiers, and ultimately find solutions to the challenges posed by prion diseases.\nOn behalf of the organizing committee, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the participants, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers who have contributed to making this congress possible. Your dedication and support are instrumental in our collective pursuit of advancing prion research.\nWe eagerly await your arrival at the 12th Iberian Prion Congress at the Universidad de Santiago - Galicia. Let us join forces, exchange knowledge, and forge new partnerships that will pave the way for a future where prion diseases are conquered, bringing hope and relief to countless individuals affected by these devastating conditions.\nThank you, and we look forward to welcoming you all in Santiago!\nThe Organizing Committee\n\n\nImportant dates\nAbstract submission deadline: 31st March 2024.\nRegistration deadline: 23rd April 2024.\nCongress: 23-24.05.2024.\n\n\n\nOrganizing and Scientific Committee\n\nLeticia Lucero López, CNB-CSIC, Spain\nGiada Lavigna, Istituto Mario Negri, Italy\nCristina Sampedro, CICbioGUNE, Spain\nSara Canoyra Sánchez, CISA-INIA-CSIC, Spain\nLeticia Camila Fernández Flores, UMG, Germany\nAnna Burato, SISSA, Italy\nLuigi Celauro, SISSA, Italy\nMichał Burdukiewicz, UMB, Poland/UAB, Spain\nNuria Lopez Lorenzo, USC, Spain\nSonia Pérez Lázaro, UNIZAR, Spain\nCacheiro Vázquez Raúl, USC, Spain\nSabzehei Sanaz, USC, Spain\nNicole Innocenti, CIBIO-UNITN, Italy\nNuno Filipe Coutinho Gonçalves Anjo, CICbioGUNE, Spain\nDino Gasparotto, UNITN & Sibylla Biotech, Italy\nIlaria Zeni, CIBIO-UNITN, Italy\nJesús Requena, USC, Spain"

Specifically, his lab explores the structural causes are for becoming a prion, what the common drivers are for prion replication, what are the mechanistic pathways for prion protein misfolding and self-assembly, and whether the same principles underlie other diseases, both inside the central nervous system and in the rest of the body.His lab combines biophysical techniques with nanoscopic imaging to study the structure, folding and dynamics of prions, both in isolation and with likely binding partners, in order to develop new strategies against prion diseases. He previously pursued his research at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, LMU Munich, The Scripps Research Institute, the Max-Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine and Washington University in St Louis.
